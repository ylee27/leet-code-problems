	/**
	 * Surrounded Regions (#130, Medium)
	 *
	 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
	 * capture all regions surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured
	 * by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 * X X X X
	 * X O O X
	 * X X O X
	 * X O X X
	 *
	 * After running your function, the board should be:
	 * X X X X
	 * X X X X
	 * X X X X
	 * X O X X
	 *
	 * Explanation:
	 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means
	 * that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
	 * Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O'
	 * on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected
	 * if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
