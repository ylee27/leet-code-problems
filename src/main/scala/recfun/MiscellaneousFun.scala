	 * Surrounded Regions (#130, Medium)
	 *
	 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O),
	 * capture all regions surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured
	 * by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 * X X X X
	 * X O O X
	 * X X O X
	 * X O X X
	 *
	 * After running your function, the board should be:
	 * X X X X
	 * X X X X
	 * X X X X
	 * X O X X
	 *
	 * Explanation:
	 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means
	 * that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
	 * Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O'
	 * on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected
	 * if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

	 * Clone Graph (#133, Medium)
	 *
	 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph,
	 * return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
	 *
	 * Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node])
	 * of its neighbors.
	 *
	 * Notes:
	 * For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed).
	 * For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with val = 2, and so on.
	 * The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
	 *
	 * Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph.
	 * Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
	 *
	 * The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return
	 * the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
