	/**
	 * Gas Station (#134, Medium)
	 *
	 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i
	 * is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas
	 * to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with
	 * an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
	 *
	 * Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit
	 * once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
	 *
	 * Note:
	 *
	 * If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
	 * Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
	 * Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
	 *
	 * Example 1:
	 *
	 * Input:
	 * gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
	 * cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
	 * Output: 3
